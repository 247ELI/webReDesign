 // Web Redesign

 // we took a restaraunt that had no website a made it all from scratch 

// Peer: Lucas Guptill - all pages look good and are mobile responsive, one little thing id change is the color of the button in the navbar because its really had to see once you go into mobile and tablet versions and for the contact page it looks really good but if you were trying to contact them itd need a send button so you can send your info, impressive menu page and everything looks really good 10/10
